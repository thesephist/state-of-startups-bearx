            <h1>State of Berkeley Startups</h1>
            <p>
                Cal's startup ecosystem is a microcosm of Silicon Valley.
                We at BearX took a deep dive into startups, founders, and events happening on BearX,
                Cal's entrepreneurship and innovation portal,
                to find out what problems Berkeley entrepreneurs are chasing next,
                and where we're headed as a community.
